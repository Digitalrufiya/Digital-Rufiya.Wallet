  <h1>My Gemstone Discovery Journey</h1>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Spiritual Beginning</h2>
    <p>
      My journey began with a powerful dream. In it, I was asked to recite the Dua of Arafat three times. A voice asked me three times what I wanted, and I replied, "To pray in front of the Kaaba." Then I was shown a black diamond and white diamond. The voice said, "Soon, you will enter Makkah for prayer. You are the richest person in the universe." That same day, I discovered rare black and white minerals on a Maldivian beach.
    </p>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Spiritual Knowledge & Skills</h2>
    <p>
      Without studying from gemology books or labs, I was spiritually guided to understand the names, properties, and identities of minerals. I could recognize them instantly. I began polishing and cutting gemstones using simple tools — without any formal training. This path reminded me of the wisdom granted to prophets like Solomon and David (peace be upon them).
    </p>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Divine Journey to Makkah</h2>
    <p>
      Three years later, I was blessed with a free trip to Makkah — all costs covered by a company. It confirmed my dream and spiritual path. I realized my responsibility: to use these gifts to help others, share knowledge, and build a transparent gem discovery initiative.

    <h2>Purpose & Vision</h2>
    <p>
      My mission is to certify, share, and sell natural gemstones to support orphans, poor communities, and Islamic educational projects. I also plan to build a transparent learning center to teach others how to recognize and value gemstones — based on internal guidance, faith, and experience.
